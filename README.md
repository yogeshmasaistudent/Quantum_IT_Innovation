# Welcome to the Quantum IT Innovation Login and Registration System

At **Quantum IT Innovation**, we are dedicated to creating cutting-edge software solutions that empower users and enhance their digital experiences. We are excited to present our latest project: a comprehensive **Login and Registration System** that exemplifies our commitment to quality and innovation.

This project implements a robust login and registration system using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **Express** and **MongoDB** for the backend. The application allows users to register, log in, and access a protected static table, ensuring secure management of user data through **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for authentication.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register with the following fields:
  - **Name**
  - **Date of Birth**
  - **Email**
  - **Password**
  
- **User Login**: Users can log in using their registered email and password.
  
- **Protected Static Table**: After successful login or registration, users can view a protected static table that displays user information.
  
- **JWT Authentication**: The system employs JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication and session management.

- **Data Storage**: User information is stored in **MongoDB** and persisted in the browser's **local storage** for seamless access.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React**: A web application framework for building dynamic single-page applications.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive design.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express**: A web framework for Node.js to handle routing and middleware.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user data.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: For secure authentication.
